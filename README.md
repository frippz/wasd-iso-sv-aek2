## FAQ

### I’m Norwegian/Danish/whatever and need to modify it a little

Not really a question, but… of course you can! The template is SVG and can be edited in a number of applications. Sketch, Affinity Designer, Adobde Illustrator, Inkscape. Fork away!

### What typeface is that?

Apple used **Univers 47 Condensed Light Oblique** for their hardware back in the day. If you want to make modifications to this layout, [you need that font](https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/univers/47-light-condensed-oblique).

### Where’s caps-lock?

I RARELY NEED TO SHOUT ON THE INTERNET. Also, since I'm a Vim user, I found an extra escape key on the home row more useful. As of macOS Sierra (10.12), you can easily remap this yourself in System Preferences. It's pretty awesome and I recommend you try it.

### Why are some of the keys not corresponding to the actual function in the OS?

Silly macOS thinks you’ve plugged in some unholy semi-Mac-compatible PC keyboard. I’m not actually sure, to be honest. I use [Karabiner Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) to remap my keys as needed. Particularly the `§` and `<` keys, that become reversed for some reason.

### Did you make this yourself?

Nah, I just found [someone else’s UK layout](http://hccdata.s3.amazonaws.com/WASD-ISO-UK-AEKII.svg) on the interwebs and modified it to make it more 🇸🇪❤️.
